                Digital pathology is the practice of digitising glass slides
                (tissue samples) using scanners to convert the glass slides into
                high resolution digital images. This allows pathologists to
                view, analyze, and share the images on a computer instead of a
                microscope.

                The scanner takes high resolution images of entire glass slides,

                slide image (WSI) that can be viewed digitally.

                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Enabling collaboration</strong> - Digital images can
                  easily and securely be shared allowing for multiple experts to
                  view, discuss and collaboratively make diagnoses on the same
                  slide simultaneously

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                First is <strong>cost</strong>, scanners, software and digital
                storage are expensive.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Standardisation</strong> also poses a significant
                challenge, there are currently different scanners and formats
                which can cause compatibility issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Workflow integration</strong> is another challenge.
                There may be resistance to change from legacy systems as well as
                the need for pathologists, hospitals and labs to undergo
                training in order to adopt digital workflow systems.

                The beauty of digital pathology lies in its scalability and
                increasing accessibility. As technology advances and costs
                decrease, we envision a future where even smaller clinics and
                remote healthcare providers can leverage these tools. Imagine a
                patient in a rural community benefiting from a specialist's
                opinion from thousands of miles away, all thanks to digital
                pathology. It has the potential to democratise access to expert

                The integration of histologic and molecular (also called -omics)
                data. When a tissue sample is taken from a patient, various
                tests and investigations are done. Imagine being able to use
                technology, which can analyze and process vast amounts of data,
                to combine the visual insights from digital pathology with
                genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data from the same tissue
                sample. This creates a holistic, multi-dimensional view of
                disease, allowing for incredibly precise diagnoses, personalised

                therapies.

                Digital pathology involves scanning physical glass slides to
                create high-resolution digital images, known as virtual or
                digital slides. Pathologists can then view and analyze these
                virtual slides on a computer screen using specialized software.
                This approach enables remote access, instant sharing, and
                seamless collaboration among professionals, unhindered by their
                physical location. Critically, the digital format allows for the
                integration of AI and machine learning tools, which can enhance
                diagnostic accuracy through objective analysis and
                quantification, leading to more streamlined and precise
                diagnoses. In contrast, traditional pathology relies on the
                direct examination of physical glass slides under a conventional
                microscope. This method has geographic limitations, as the
                pathologist must be physically present with the slides and a
                microscope to conduct their analysis. Sharing cases for second
                opinions typically requires shipping these physical slides,
                which can be a slow process and carries the risk of damage or
                loss. While foundational, traditional pathology doesn't allow
                for automated analysis and can introduce workflow inefficiencies
                due to its manual handling and storage requirements.
